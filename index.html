            <p>
                <span class="atty-love">"Attitude of Gratitude"</span> refers to cultivating a mindset and behaviour
                that
                appreciates and acknowledges the positive contributions and actions of our team members. We want to
                emphasise the importance of acknowledging and celebrating the efforts and impact individuals make, not
                only in their professional performance but also in their interactions and support towards others.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-h1"> Nominee Guidelines</h1>
            <p>
                When nominating an employee for their contributions in the workplace, consider whether they exemplified
                one of <span class="empha">Outsell's</span> core values or demonstrated competency
                relevant to their role. It is also important to acknowledge that <span class="empha">sometimes it is not
                    solely
                    about the tasks we perform, but rather the profound impact we have on others</span>. We
                encourage
                nominations for employees who have exhibited kindness, generosity, or helpfulness, reflecting on the
                depth
                of their character and their ability to influence those around them.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sub-h1">Submissions & Deadlines</h1>
            <p>Submissions for the <span class="love">Gratifier of the Month</span> will start the day after our monthly
                in-office meeting, and will be announced as <span class="empha">'open'</span> via Slack. Please send
                your submissions via email to <span class="atty">nhu.richards@outsell.com</span> and <span
                    class="atty">natalie.passus-yang@outsell.com</span></p>
            <p>
                Deadlines for submissions will be set one week prior to the announcement of <span class="love">Gratifier
                    of the
                    Month</span>, and will be announced as <span class="empha">'closed'</span> via Slack by 4PM CST/CDT.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sub-h1">Announcement</h1>
            <p><span class="love">Gratifier of the Month</span> will be announced at our monthly in-office meeting and
                shared in the <span class="atty">#attitudeofgratitude</span> Slack channel for those unable to attend.
                As a token of appreciation, they will receive a <span class="atty">$25 gift card</span> from a list of
                available options.
