                <span class="atty-love">"Attitude of Gratitude"</span> refers to cultivating a mindset and behaviour
                that
                appreciates and acknowledges the positive contributions and actions of our team members. We want to
                emphasise the importance of acknowledging and celebrating the efforts and impact individuals make, not
                only in their professional performance but also in their interactions and support towards others.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-h1"> Nominee Guidelines</h1>
            <p>
                When nominating an employee for their contributions in the workplace, it is essential to
                evaluate whether they have exemplified one of our company's core values or demonstrated competency
                relevant to their role. It is also important to acknowledge that <span class="love">sometimes it is not
                    solely
                    about the tasks we perform, but rather the profound impact we have on others</span>. Therefore, we
                encourage
                nominations for employees who have exhibited kindness, generosity, or helpfulness, reflecting on the
                depth
                of their character and their ability to positively influence those around them.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sub-h1">Submissions & Deadlines</h1>
            <p>Submissions for the <span class="love">Gratifier of the Month</span> will start the day following the
                announcement at our monthly
                in-office meetings, and will be announced as <span class="empha">'open'</span> via Slack. Please send
